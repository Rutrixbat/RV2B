   You don't need RimNude or other clothing removers for this; bellies render above everything but outer/shell apparel. Most armor will look a little odd.
   Foxbold also have a patch to let anyone wear their sandcloaks, and graphics are included for all standard body types. They're slightly worse than flak jackets, but they look great with bellies.

   The bulge hediff is applied on vore record population; there's no need for a new save, but preds do need to vore something for bulges to appear.
   Bulges only show up if the hediff is at 0.4 or greater; for humans, this means anything at least the size of a raccoon. It's based on total prey size, so 2 hares work too.
   Only prey in the stomach, intestines or womb count for this. Sorry; there's only belly graphics here.
   Bigger races need bigger prey for a bulge, and smaller need smaller; snakes (bodysize 2.0) need slightly less than a wolf, and slugcats (bodysize 0.5) just need a single hare.

   Don't worry if you don't have a race listed here; The patches are conditional. They don't even throw up an error.
   This all shouldn't affect TPS that much.

   The aliases have been patched so that Irkin can nom (they don't have stomachs, they have squeedilyspooches).

   Ferian have been patched to allow grappling.

   Apini and Azuri have been patched to have their heads moved up a little, showing a bit more of their torso (read: belly) and generaly looking a little closer to the artwork for them. 
   The neck fluff apparel was moved to match.
   The apron was patched to be on the outer/shell layer, so they render over bellies. This shouldn't affect what they can equip.

   All apparel can be set up to have bulged versions; the only thing stopping it is lack of art. Currently, there's only a few; Parkas, apini aprons and flak vests, and the vessel cloaks and dress.
   No, really, graphics are all that's needed. Check the other .txt.

   If there's a race you'd like support for, let me know. Odds are, they use mostly the same (if not <the> same) body graphics as humans; and thus, the same belly and offsets. Ez pz.
   If you'd like to try, it may <actualy> be as simple as copying Bulges_Human.xml and replacing the racedefs as needed.
	You'll need to check if they have a alienPartGenerator/bodyAddons portion of their race def, and edit accordingly.

   -Rim-Vali dosn't use HAR. They're immune to vore bulges. I tried messing with them, and it requires transpiling the RimValiCore dlls, and ain't noone got time for that.

   If you're better at art than me (you are), feel free to resprite, help with bulge equipment, anything you want.

   The slugcat race used to be on the workshop (as "slime cats", for some reason), but it seems to have been taken down.
   The mod included is a resprite that was shared in the comments of it.
   They're, ah, not exactly balanced. 200% base tame chance, 1% base food poison chance, 66% base damage taken... but slugcat, tho!

   	-Bellies won't show up!
		[ Only the races listed above have patches; other races don't have bulges. ]
		If there's one you desperatly need, let me know; or, give a hand at your own patch. They're not too hard to make, and a lot of races can use the default belly.
		The patches included look, uh, odd, but they work for both 1.3 and 1.4 without needing seperate loadfolders.
		I did this because it's convienient, and NOT because I started on this before 1.4 was a thing, found they worked anyway, and I'm lazy.

		[ Bellies only show up for the, uh, well, belly. ]
		Turning someone into tailstuffing will not give you a belly. Prey have to be in the [ stomach, intesines, womb or torso ].
     		Also, prey need to be big enough. For a human, raccoons (bodysize 0.4) or bigger are needed; for slugcats, hares (bodysize 0.2) are good enough.
		It's cumulative, so 4 rats will work too.
		There's only 1 belly graphic, but more could be added (if I were better at art /shrug)

		[ If you can't even have the bulge hediff show up in dev tools, there's a conflict going on. ]
		Specificaly, something making the hediffclass for HediffDef.RV2B_Bulge come up null, making the hediff fail to load.
		There's not much to do here other than systematicly going through mods untill it goes away. Disable half, check, disable half, check...
		If you find a mod that conflicts, send me to it. I might be able to figure it out.
	
	-How do I make bulged apparel?
		Bulged apparel need a _bulged.png version of the apparel, placed in the same file path as the original apparel .pngs.
		For instance, for the Flak Jacket, the original texture is in Textures/Things/Pawn/Humanlike/Apparel/FlakJacket/FlakJacket.

		4 textures for each bodytype are needed; in the Flak Jacket's case; 
			FlakJacket_<bodytype>_bulged, FlakJacket_<bodytype>_bulged_east, FlakJacket_<bodytype>_bulged_south, FlakJacket_<bodytype>_bulged_north.

		You can also set up race specific graphics, too; FlakJacket_<bodytype>_<pawnrace>_bulged
		The mod checks if <apparel>_<bodytype>_bulged exists, and applies the graphics as long as the bulged hediff is 0.2 or greater, the same condition as the bulges themselves.
		Check the apperal included for an example.



   If any mod authors deem their race's inclusion in this problematic, let me know and I'll cut support. I swear, I mean no disrespect.



   Now please tell Calypso that she's a very good belly animus vox, and that Rut appreciates every single one of her belly nuzzles very much.
